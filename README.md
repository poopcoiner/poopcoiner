# Hi, I'm Dominic

Full-stack engineer with a product mindset. I work mostly with **TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL**, and I like building things that real people can actually use.

I’ve shipped dashboards, Web3 tools, small AI integrations, internal platforms, and a handful of scrappy MVPs.

### Tools I use often
Next.js · React · TypeScript · Node.js  
PostgreSQL · Supabase · Docker · GitHub Actions  
Jest / Vitest · Supertest · Cypress  
Sui SDK · Figma handoff

### What I’m into
Clear UI, clean APIs, fast iteration, and solving small problems end-to-end.

Pinned repos = things I’ve built, used, or learned from.
